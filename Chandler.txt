Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.

Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.

Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah?

Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.

Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?!

Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.

Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.

Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah?

Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.

Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?!

Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.

Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.

Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah?

Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.

Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?!

Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.

Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.

Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah?

Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.

Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?!

Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.

Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead. 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
Chandler: ...Dinah? 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
