Rachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Phoebe: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Chandler and Joey: Oh! Yeah!
Chandler and Joey: Oh! Yeah!
Joey: Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Joey: .....Well, this is still ruined, right?
Mrs. Geller: (To Monica) And you knew about this?! 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here?
