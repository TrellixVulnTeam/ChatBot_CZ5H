Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?

Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.

Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.)

Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.

Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean?

Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...

Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression.

Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad...

Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours.

Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?

Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.

Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.)

Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.

Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean?

Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...

Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression.

Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad...

Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours.

Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?

Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.

Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.)

Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.

Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean?

Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...

Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression.

Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad...

Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours.

Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.) 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. 
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression. 
Monica: No it's not. 
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.) 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Monica: (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 
Monica: Absolutely. 
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.) 
Monica: (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
Chandler: (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we! 
Rachel: (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 
Monica: You didn't. 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry... 
Monica: I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.) 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... 
Monica: (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Phoebe: (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her. 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
