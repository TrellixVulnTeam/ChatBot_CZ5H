Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.

Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.

Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?

Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?

Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)

Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes!

Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack..

Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-

Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up?

Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?

Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.

Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)

Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)

Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes!

Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack..

Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-

Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up?

Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?

Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.

Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)

Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)

Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes!

Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack..

Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-

Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up?

Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?

Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.

Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)

Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)

Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes!

Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack..

Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-

Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up?

Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?

Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.

Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)

Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)

Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes!

Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack..

Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-

Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up?

Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?

Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.

Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)

Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)

Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes!

Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack..

Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-

Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up?

Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?

Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.

Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)

Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)

Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes!

Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack..

Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-

Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up?

Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?

Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.

Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)

Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)

Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes!

Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack..

Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-

Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt. 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
Joey: (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues. 
Ross: Does she. 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up?

Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross: (trying to ignore her) No. No. 
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
Ross:Hi. 
Carol: So. 
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 
Carol: Sorry. You look good too. 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant. 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in. 
Ross: (standing outside the door).....Hi. 
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. 
Ross: Carol's pregnant. 
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.) 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow. 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father. 
Mrs. Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him. 
Ross: Aw, Mom... 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.) 
Monica: (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 
Ross: (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours. 
Ross: Must pee. (Goes to pee.) 
Rachel: The lights, please..
Ross: ...How long was I in there? 
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up. 
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.) 
Ross: Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 
Rachel: Oh.. a little.. 
Ross: Mm-hmm.. 
Rachel: A lot. 
Ross: Mm. 
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped? 
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... 
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? 
Ross: Got me. 
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? 
Ross: Yeah. 
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross? 
Ross: Yes, yes! 
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.) 
Ross: (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 
Carol: Ross, you remember Susan. 
Ross: How could I forget? 
Susan: Ross. 
Ross: (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? 
Carol: Dr. Oberman. 
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 
Susan: She. 
Ross: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation? 
Carol: Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Ross: Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.  
Carol: Thanks. 
Ross: (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack.. 
Robbie: Okay. 
Ross: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? 
Carol: Give me a 'for instance'. 
Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? 
Carol: Marlon- 
Ross: Marlon?! 
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 
Ross: ...As in Mouse? 
Carol: As in my grandmother. 
Ross: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? 
Susan: We agreed on Minnie. 
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? 
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so. 
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 
Ross: Thank you! 
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller. 
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch. 
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 
Susan: It's my baby too. 
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm. 
Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse. 
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back.. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. 
Ross: Oh my God. 
Carol: I know. 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 
Monica: (welling up) Mm-hmm. 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up? 
Monica: No. 
Ross: You are, you're welling up. 
Monica: Am not! 
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt.
